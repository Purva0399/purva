A student of speaking or writing needs several things from their online teacher to succeed: clear and structured guidance, personalized feedback, and interactive practice opportunities. The teacher should provide clear explanations of grammar, vocabulary, and language structure, while also offering constructive feedback on the student's progress. Regular opportunities for the student to practice speaking or writing in real-world contexts are essential for improvement. The teacher should also be patient, encouraging, and responsive, creating a supportive environment where the student feels comfortable making mistakes and learning from them. Additionally, access to resources, such as examples and exercises, can help reinforce learning.
